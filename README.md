- Identify top-performing tracks and artists based on total streams  
- Understand daily, monthly, and release-year streaming trends  
- Measure percentage contribution of individual tracks to total streams  
- Analyze the impact of audio features such as energy, danceability, and acousticness  
- Enable data-driven marketing and promotion strategies
