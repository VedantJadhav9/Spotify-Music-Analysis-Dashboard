# Spotify-Music-Analysis-Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 950+ Spotify tracks and 489B+ streams using DAX, Power Query, and advanced data visualization

📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Spotify Music Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, aimed at uncovering insights from large-scale music streaming data. The dashboard analyzes track popularity, streaming trends, artist performance, and audio characteristics to support data-driven decision-making in the music industry.The project demonstrates end-to-end BI skills including data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

🧩 Problem Statement
Music streaming platforms generate massive volumes of listening data, but raw streaming numbers alone do not reveal meaningful insights about listener behavior, track performance, or artist popularity. Stakeholders such as record labels, marketing teams, and platform analysts need a centralized, interactive system to analyze streaming trends, identify high-performing tracks, and understand how audio characteristics influence song success.The challenge is to transform large-scale Spotify streaming data into actionable insights that support strategic decisions related to promotion, content curation, and audience engagement.

🎯 Business Objectives
The primary business objectives of this project are:
Analyze overall streaming performance across tracks and artists
Identify top-performing tracks and artists based on total streams
Understand time-based streaming trends (daily, monthly, release-year patterns)
Measure the contribution percentage of individual tracks to total streams
Analyze the impact of audio features (energy, danceability, acousticness, etc.) on popularity
Enable stakeholders to make data-driven marketing and promotion decisions
Provide an interactive dashboard that allows dynamic exploration using filters and slicers
